I got an Azure Sphere kit a few weeks ago and I had a chance to experiment using it during my free time.  
The kit are now available and the software is in public beta and, even if it's still lacking many features, it's a great way to start experimenting with this new technology.  
Documentation has been release a few weeks before the official announcement and it provides a good idea of how the system work (I think it's not correct to think about Azure Sphere as a device, since it involves also cloud-based services) and on how to set-up your device and development environment. You can find it on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/</a>.
