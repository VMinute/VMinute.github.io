I learned BASIC on a VIC-20, at those time computer magazines used to have pages filled with long listings that you had to re-type on your own computer. It was boring but also was a chance to look at the code (open source was already a thing back in the 80s) and learn.
I started developing "real" software when I was serving in the Italian army, in 1993.

I moved to professional software development in 1994 and I had a chance to play with lots of different technologies, from MS-DOS to Java Applets, from SNA networks to databases, from early server-side web development using CGI and ASP to communication protocols over TCP/IP, NetBIOS, and other now-extinct technologies. I am probably a programming dinosaur, considering how much time I've been spending writing code. But I still like doing it.

Since 1999 I have been working mostly on embedded devices (IoT was no longer a thing back at that time), and since then I worked on many cool projects in industrial automation, automotive, home automation and lots of other fields.

I am a Microsoft MVP since 2009.

In 2013 I joined <a title="Toradex" href="https://www.toradex.com">Toradex</a>, working on BSPs and drivers.
